# Device Repository for LoRaWAN®

The Device Repository contains information about LoRaWAN end devices. The Device Repository acts as key data source for device catalogs and onboarding devices on LoRaWAN networks.

We welcome device makers to contribute information to help users find and onboard end devices in products and services developed and offered by The Things Industries, including [The Things Stack](https://www.thethingsindustries.com/docs/).

To help you add devices to this repository, you can follow along in this example video where we walk through all of the instructions below.

[![Adding devices to the device repository](https://img.youtube.com/vi/pnwtEgw4f-c/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnwtEgw4f-c)

## Prerequisites

One of the operating systems:

- Linux
- macOS
- Windows Subsystem for Linux ([Install](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) and [Upgrade WSL Go version](https://sal.as/post/install-golan-on-wsl/))

Development dependencies:

- Node.js version 16.x 
  - (This is recommended, as newer versions may give errors)
- npm version 8.x
- Go version 1.18.x

To check your Node.js, npm and Go versions:

```bash
$ node -v
$ npm -v
$ go version
```

[Download and install Node.js and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) and [Download Go](https://golang.org/dl/).

Then, install the dependencies:

```bash
$ make deps
```

## Contributing

If you want to submit your devices to the Device Repository, fork this repository and open a pull request. [Learn how to fork and create pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).

Pull requests are validated automatically. If there are any validation or formatting errors, the validation checks will not pass, and the pull request will not be merged until those errors are resolved. Therefore, before creating a pull request, run the following action to validate and format your data locally:

```bash
$ make validate fmt
```

Contributors are required to sign the [Contributor License Agreement](https://gist.github.com/johanstokking/58081d646d6dd4f93b3d85cd5c62377c).

## Validation

The Device Repository contains tooling to validate all data against a schema. This is necessary for all data to be loaded automatically in The Things Stack and other services.

To validate data:

```bash
$ make validate
```

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a great editor for editing the Device Repository. You can validate your data automatically using the [YAML plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-yaml).

The YAML plugin supports you with filling out the document. When hitting Ctrl + Space, all fields are shown. The Debug Console of Visual Studio provides feedback by highlighting the incorrect fields.

## Files and Directories

There are six file types in the Device Repository:

1. **Vendor index** with a list of vendors (`vendor/index.yaml`)
2. **Vendor device index** with all the devices of a vendor (`vendor/<vendor-id>/index.yaml`)
3. **End device definition** of a single device (`vendor/<vendor-id>/<device-id>.yaml`)
4. **End device profile** for one or more devices (`vendor/<vendor-id>/<profile-id>.yaml`). **Note**: this can also refer to a profile in a different vendor folder, by specifying the `vendorID`. See below for an example
5. **Payload codec definition** for one or more devices (`vendor/<vendor-id>/<codec>.yaml`)
6. **Payload codec implementation** to decode and encode payload (`vendor/<vendor-id>/<codec>.js`)

> All files and folders must have lowercase titles.

An example directory structure with a vendor named `company-x` that produces two devices (`device-a` and `device-b`). There's a module maker named `module-maker` that provides a standard profile `module-profile-eu868` that can be referenced by end device vendors:

```bash
lorawan-devices
├── vendor
│   ├── index.yaml                    # vendor index (1)
│   ├── module-maker
│   │   └── module-profile-eu868.yaml # generic end device profile for EU868 (4)
│   ├── company-x
│   │   ├── index.yaml                # vendor device index (2)
│   │   ├── logo.svg                  # vendor logo
│   │   ├── device-a.png              # photo of device-a
│   │   ├── device-a.yaml             # device-a definition (3)
│   │   ├── device-b.png              # photo of device-b
│   │   ├── device-b.yaml             # device-b definition (3)
│   │   ├── custom-profile-us915.yaml # end device profile for US915 (4)
│   │   ├── codec.js                  # payload codec implementation (6)
│   │   └── codec.yaml                # payload codec definition (5)
```

### Vendor Index

First, make sure that your company is listed in the **Vendor index** in `vendor/index.yaml` and that the information is complete.

If your company is not listed or if you want to add additional information, add your information like so:

```yaml
vendors:
  - # Unique identifier of the vendor (lowercase, alphanumeric with dashes, max 36 characters)
    id: company-x
    # Vendor company name
    name: Company X
    # Vendor company description (optional)
    description:
    # LoRa Alliance issued Vendor ID
    vendorID: 10
    # Vendor website (optional)
    website: https://www.company-x.com
    # Vendor logo filename (optional)
    logo: logo.svg
    # Vendor social media links and handles (optional)
    social:
      linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/company/company-x/ # uri
      facebook: https://www.facebook.com/company-x # uri
      twitter: company-x  # handle
      instagram: company-x # handle
      github: company-x # handle
    # Organization Unique Identifiers (OUIs, six digit hex, optional): http://standards-oui.ieee.org/oui.txt
    # The OUI is typically the first 3 bytes of the DevEUI
    ouis:
      - FCD6BD
    # Private Enterprise Number (optional): https://www.iana.org/assignments/enterprise-numbers/enterprise-numbers
    pen: 42
```

The vendor data will be in the `vendor/<vendor-id>` folder (e.g. `vendor/company-x`). Create the folder if it does not exist yet.

### Vendor Device Index

All vendor data is referenced from the **Vendor device index** file: `vendor/<vendor-id>/index.yaml`:

```yaml
endDevices:
  - device-a
  - device-b
```

All end device identifiers must be lowercase, alphanumeric with dashes and max 36 characters. **Make sure you include every device you add.**

### End Device

For each end device, create an **End device definition** file with the same filename as the identifier in the index: `vendor/<vendor-id>/<device-id>.yaml`:

```yaml
name: Device A
description: My first LoRaWAN device
# Hardware versions (optional)
hardwareVersions:
  - version: '1.0'
    numeric: 1
# Firmware versions (at least one is mandatory)
firmwareVersions:
  - # Firmware version
    version: '1.0'
    numeric: 1
    # Supported hardware versions (optional)
    hardwareVersions:
      - '1.0' # Must refer to hardwareVersions declared above
    # LoRaWAN Device Profiles per region
    # Supported regions: EU863-870, US902-928, AU915-928, AS923, CN779-787, EU433, CN470-510, KR920-923, IN865-867, RU864-870
    profiles:
      EU863-870:
        # Optional identifier of the vendor of the profile. When you specify the vendorID, the profile is loaded from
        # the vendorID's folder. This allows you to reuse profiles from module or LoRaWAN end device stack vendors.
        # When vendorID is empty, the profile is loaded from the current directory.
        vendorID: module-maker
        # Unique identifier of the profile (lowercase, alphanumeric with dashes, max 36 characters).
        # This is the file name of the profile and must have the .yaml extension.
        id: module-profile-eu868
        # Specify whether the device is LoRa Alliance certified.
        lorawanCertified: true
        codec: device-a-codec
      US902-928:
        # This is the file name of the profile and must have the .yaml extension.
        id: custom-profile-us915
        # Specify whether the device is LoRa Alliance certified.
        lorawanCertified: true
        # This is the file name of the codec defintion and must have the .yaml extension.
        codec: device-a-codec
```

There are many other fields that can be set: hardware versions, firmware versions, sensors, dimensions, weight, battery information, operating conditions, IP code, security information, photos and regulatory and compliancy information. See [Example Wind Sensor](./vendor/example/windsensor.yaml) for a full example.

> **NOTE** It is highly recommended to fill out as many information about the end devices as possible. The definition above is the bare minimum information.

### End Device Image

There are a few guidelines to follow for images:
- At least 1 image of each device you intent to add.
- Make sure the image has a transparent background. 
- Image should be of high quality.
- The image cannot be bigger then 2000 x 2000 pixels. 

### End Device Profile

Each referenced end device profile needs to be defined in the **End device profile**, with the same filename as the profile ID: `vendor/<vendor-id>/<profile-id>.yaml`:

```yaml
# Vendor profile ID, can be freely issued by the vendor. NOTE: The vendor profile ID is different from the vendorID. 
# The vendor Profile ID should be an incremental counter for every unique device listed in the vendor's folder.
# This vendor profile ID is also used on the QR code for LoRaWAN devices, see
# https://lora-alliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/TR005_LoRaWAN_Device_Identification_QR_Codes.pdf
vendorProfileID: 0

# LoRaWAN MAC version: 1.0, 1.0.1, 1.0.2, 1.0.3, 1.0.4 or 1.1
macVersion: '1.0.3'
# LoRaWAN Regional Parameters version. Values depend on the LoRaWAN version:
#   1.0:   TS001-1.0
#   1.0.1: TS001-1.0.1
#   1.0.2: RP001-1.0.2 or RP001-1.0.2-RevB
#   1.0.3: RP001-1.0.3-RevA
#   1.0.4: RP002-1.0.0, RP002-1.0.1, RP002-1.0.2, RP002-1.0.3 or RP002-1.0.4
#   1.1:   RP001-1.1-RevA or RP001-1.1-RevB
regionalParametersVersion: 'RP001-1.0.3-RevA'

# Whether the end device supports join (OTAA) or not (ABP)
supportsJoin: true
# If your device is an ABP device (supportsJoin is false), uncomment the following fields:
# RX1 delay
#rx1Delay: 5
# RX1 data rate offset
#rx1DataRateOffset: 0
# RX2 data rate index
#rx2DataRateIndex: 0
# RX2 frequency (MHz)
#rx2Frequency: 869.525
# Factory preset frequencies (MHz)
#factoryPresetFrequencies: [868.1, 868.3, 868.5, 867.1, 867.3, 867.5, 867.7, 867.9]

# Maximum EIRP
maxEIRP: 16
# Whether the end device supports 32-bit frame counters
supports32bitFCnt: true

# Whether the end device supports class B
supportsClassB: false
# If your device supports class B, uncomment the following fields:
# Maximum delay for the end device to answer a MAC request or confirmed downlink frame (seconds)
#classBTimeout: 60
# Ping slot period (seconds)
#pingSlotPeriod: 128
# Ping slot data rate index
#pingSlotDataRateIndex: 0
# Ping slot frequency (MHz). Set to 0 if the band supports ping slot frequency hopping.
#pingSlotFrequency: 869.525

# Whether the end device supports class C
supportsClassC: false
# If your device supports class C, uncomment the following fields:
# Maximum delay for the end device to answer a MAC request or confirmed downlink frame (seconds)
#classCTimeout: 60
```

For more information and for fields for ABP, see [LoRaWAN Schema: Devices Draft 1](https://lorawan-schema.org/draft/devices/1/).

### Payload Codecs

The Device Repository supports three payload codecs to be defined:

1. Uplink decoder: decodes binary data uplink into a JSON object
2. Downlink encoder: decodes a JSON object into binary data downlink
3. Downlink decoder: decodes an encoded binary data downlink back into a JSON object (must be symmetric with the downlink encoder)

**Note:** We recommend using measure units and full variable names in payload decoders for a better user experience.

The codecs can all be defined in one file as they are defined by their function names. The codecs must be written in JavaScript (ECMAScript 5.1+). [See link](https://thethingsstack.io/integrations/payload-formatters/javascript/) for instructions on how to write decoders and encoders.

The codecs are defined in the **Payload codec definition** file, with the same filename as the codec ID: `vendor/<vendor-id>/<codec>.yaml`:

```yaml
# Uplink decoder decodes binary data uplink into a JSON object (optional)
# For documentation on writing encoders and decoders, see: https://thethingsstack.io/integrations/payload-formatters/javascript/
uplinkDecoder:
  fileName: codec.js
  # Examples (optional)
  examples:
    - description: 32 knots from the North
      input:
        fPort: 1
        bytes: [0, 32]
      output:
        data:
          direction: 'N'
          speed: 32
      # Normalized output, uses the normalizeUplink function (optional)
      normalizedOutput:
        data:
          - wind:
              speed: 16.4608
              direction: 0
# Downlink encoder encodes JSON object into a binary data downlink (optional)
downlinkEncoder:
  fileName: codec.js
  # Examples (optional)
  examples:
    - description: Turn green
      input:
        data:
          led: green
      output:
        bytes: [1]
        fPort: 2
# Downlink decoder decodes the encoded downlink message (optional, must be symmetric with downlinkEncoder)
downlinkDecoder:
  fileName: codec.js
  # Examples (optional)
  examples:
    - description: Turn green
      input:
        fPort: 2
        bytes: [1]
      output:
        data:
          led: green
```

The actual **Payload codec implementation** is in the referenced filename: `vendor/<vendor-id>/<codec-filename>`.

See [The Things Stack documentation](https://www.thethingsindustries.com/docs/integrations/payload-formatters/javascript) for how to write JavaScript functions for decoding, normalizing and encoding data.
