name: LDDS75
description: The Dragino LDDS75 consists of an ultrasonic detection sensor for measuring the distance between the sensor and a flat object. It is used to measure the distance between the sensor and a flat object. It uses temperature compensation to improve the reliability of data. The measured distance data are sent to a LoRaWANÂ® network for further analysis.
