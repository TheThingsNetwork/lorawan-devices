name: ELV experimental platform for LoRaWAN
description: The modular system of ELV Elektronik AG makes it possible to carry out LoRaWAN experiments. The basis is the ELV LoRaWAN Base, on which various application modules and power modules equipped with sensors can be attached. The integrated antenna and compact form factor allow experiments to be carried out flexibly. The required firmware is provided by ELV, but the programming adapter can also be used to execute your own code.

      EU863-870:
        # Optional identifier of the vendor of the profile. When you specify the vendorID, the profile is loaded from
        # the vendorID's folder. This allows you to reuse profiles from module or LoRaWAN end device stack vendors.
        # If vendorID is empty, the current vendor ID is used. In this example, the vendorID is the current vendor ID,
        # which is verbose.
        #vendorID: elv
        # Identifier of the profile (lowercase, alphanumeric with dashes, max 36 characters)
