name: Motion Sensor
description: The Motion Sensor utilizes LoRaWAN connectivity to communicate the presence or not of a person. The intended use is to place the sensor with a good view of a room to determine if there is motion in the room or not.
The sensor is composed of a Passive Infrared Detector and Fresnel Lens. The main body contains the active electronics to measure movement and transmit any changes to a LoRaWAN network.
