name: Door/Window Sensor
description: The Door & Window sensor utilizes LoRaWAN connectivity to communicate the proximity or not of a magnet. The intended use is to place the sensor and magnet on separate elements of a door or window to determine if the door or window is open or closed.
The sensor is composed of two parts. The main body contains the active electronics to measure magnetic fields and transmit any changes to a LoRaWAN network. The second part is a permanent magnet of sufficient field strength to be detected by the Hall Effect sensor on the main body.
