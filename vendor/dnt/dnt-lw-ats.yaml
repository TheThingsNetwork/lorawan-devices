name: LoRaWAN® Solar-GPS-Tracker
description: The dnt LoRaWAN® Asset Tracker Solar is a reliable and compact GNSS tracker with a water- and dust proof housing according to IP44. Through the built-in solar cell, self-sufficient operation is possible. The position determination can be done cyclically or motion-based. In addition, there are many configuration options through LoRaWAN® downlinks, like the motion sensitivity or the positioning interval. The average sleep mode current is below 10 µA.

      EU863-870:
        # Optional identifier of the vendor of the profile. When you specify the vendorID, the profile is loaded from
        # the vendorID's folder. This allows you to reuse profiles from module or LoRaWAN end device stack vendors.
        # If vendorID is empty, the current vendor ID is used. In this example, the vendorID is the current vendor ID,
        # which is verbose.
        # Identifier of the profile (lowercase, alphanumeric with dashes, max 36 characters)
