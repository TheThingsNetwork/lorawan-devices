name: LoRaWAN® window sensor and contact interface
description: The dnt LoRaWAN® window sensor and contact interface can detect the state of a window of a door (open/closed) via the integrated magnetometer or the contact interface. Besides an external reed contact, it is also possible to attach a glas-break sensor to the contact interface to use the device in security context.

        # Optional identifier of the vendor of the profile. When you specify the vendorID, the profile is loaded from
        # the vendorID's folder. This allows you to reuse profiles from module or LoRaWAN end device stack vendors.
        # If vendorID is empty, the current vendor ID is used. In this example, the vendorID is the current vendor ID,
        # which is verbose.
