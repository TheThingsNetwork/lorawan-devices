name: LoRaWAN® Radiator Thermostat Controllable
description: 'The dnt® LoRaWAN® Radiator thermostat Controllable enables two ways to adjust the room temperature: directly on the device with the integrated buttons or remote control via Downlinks. It features an always-on display to show the current temperature settings, three customizable heating profiles with up to ten switching times per day, a window open detection to automatically reduce temperature and the possibility to perform a dynamic adaptive adjustment of the radiator. Because of very low energy consumption, a battery life up to 3 years can be archived.'
