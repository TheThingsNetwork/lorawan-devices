name: acw-pir90-i
description: ACW-ILB (Infrared Light Barrier) infrared presence detection when a person passes between the barriers.This wireless barrier has 4 active infrared beams and is intended for outdoor use over a range of 100 m. It is waterproof IP65, autonomous for several years and connected. The alerts and detections are transmitted on the networks LoRaWAN and its configuration is configurable from the tools of the ATIM suite.

      EU863-870:
        # Optional identifier of the vendor of the profile. When you specify the vendorID, the profile is loaded from
        # the vendorID's folder. This allows you to reuse profiles from module or LoRaWAN end device stack vendors.
        # If vendorID is empty, the current vendor ID is used. In this example, the vendorID is the current vendor ID,
        # which is verbose.
