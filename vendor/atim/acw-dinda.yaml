description: The DINDA facilitates the wireless supervision of an analog signal from a 4-20 mA or 0-10V sensor.  It takes care of controlling the power supply of the sensor in order to optimize the energy consumption, it is thus particularly adapted for the isolated sites without energy.  In this case, a small solar panel or a simple battery can power the sensor and the radio transmitter.The readings are regularly transmitted on LoRaWAN networks and its configuration is configurable from the tools of the ATIM suite.

    profiles:
      EU863-870:
        # Optional identifier of the vendor of the profile. When you specify the vendorID, the profile is loaded from
        # the vendorID's folder. This allows you to reuse profiles from module or LoRaWAN end device stack vendors.
        # If vendorID is empty, the current vendor ID is used. In this example, the vendorID is the current vendor ID,
        # which is verbose.
