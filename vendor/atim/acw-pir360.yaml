name: ACW-PIR360 - 360° Indoor Ceiling Motion Sensor
description: The PIR range facilitates the monitoring of sites thanks to its alarm and counting detection modes. The alerts are transmitted on LoRaWAN networks and its configuration is configurable from the tools of the ATIM suite.

    profiles:
      EU863-870:
        # Optional identifier of the vendor of the profile. When you specify the vendorID, the profile is loaded from
        # the vendorID's folder. This allows you to reuse profiles from module or LoRaWAN end device stack vendors.
        # If vendorID is empty, the current vendor ID is used. In this example, the vendorID is the current vendor ID,
        # which is verbose.
