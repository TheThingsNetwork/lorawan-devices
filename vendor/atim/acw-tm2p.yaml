name: ACW-TM2P - Temperature Probe
description: The TMxP facilitates the monitoring of up to two remote temperatures of your buildings and energy installations thanks to its two meters long -196°C | +200°C temperature probes. Measurements are regularly transmitted on** LoRaWAN** networks and its configuration is configurable from the tools of the ATIM suite.

      EU863-870:
        # Optional identifier of the vendor of the profile. When you specify the vendorID, the profile is loaded from
        # the vendorID's folder. This allows you to reuse profiles from module or LoRaWAN end device stack vendors.
        # If vendorID is empty, the current vendor ID is used. In this example, the vendorID is the current vendor ID,
        # which is verbose.
