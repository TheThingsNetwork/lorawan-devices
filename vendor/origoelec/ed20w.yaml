name: ED20W - LoRaWAN Smartwatch
description: ED20W is a smart IoT watch based on LoRaWAN. Combined with motion sensor, it can achieve indoor and outdoor real-time positioning. With wearing detection, it can realize a real-time collection of health data such as heart rate, body temperature,blood pressure, and steps. The data will be transmitted to the platform through the LoRaWAN Network.

    profiles:
      EU863-870:
        # Optional identifier of the vendor of the profile. When you specify the vendorID, the profile is loaded from
        # the vendorID's folder. This allows you to reuse profiles from module or LoRaWAN end device stack vendors.
        # If vendorID is empty, the current vendor ID is used. In this example, the vendorID is the current vendor ID,
        # which is verbose.
