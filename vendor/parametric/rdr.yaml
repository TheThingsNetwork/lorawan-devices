name: RDR LORA NFC/RFID READER
description: The device reads NFC tags, stores the content together with a timestamp in an internal data buffer. The data is transmitted via a standard LoRaWAN network. The small and stylish device can be mounted on a wall or used as a table top device. The unit is powered by 4x AAA alkaline or NiMH batteries and a USB power supply.

        # Optional identifier of the vendor of the profile. When you specify the vendorID, the profile is loaded from
        # the vendorID's folder. This allows you to reuse profiles from module or LoRaWAN end device stack vendors.
        # If vendorID is empty, the current vendor ID is used. In this example, the vendorID is the current vendor ID,
        # which is verbose.
