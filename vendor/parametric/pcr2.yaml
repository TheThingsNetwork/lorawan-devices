name: PCR2 Radar People Counter
description: Parametric‘s PCR2 people counter uses radar signals to provide a camera-less solution. Utilising LoRaWAN™ technology, these sensors transmit data at regular intervals. With bi-directional counting, the Parametric PCR2 people counter registers people passing by from left or right.

      EU863-870:
        # Optional identifier of the vendor of the profile. When you specify the vendorID, the profile is loaded from
        # the vendorID's folder. This allows you to reuse profiles from module or LoRaWAN end device stack vendors.
        # If vendorID is empty, the current vendor ID is used. In this example, the vendorID is the current vendor ID,
        # which is verbose.
        # vendorID: example
        # Identifier of the profile (lowercase, alphanumeric with dashes, max 36 characters)
