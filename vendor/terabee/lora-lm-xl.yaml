    # LoRaWAN Device Profiles per region
    # Supported regions are EU863-870, US902-928, AU915-928, AS923, CN779-787, EU433, CN470-510, KR920-923, IN865-867,
    # RU864-870
    profiles:
      EU863-870:
        # Optional identifier of the vendor of the profile. When you specify the vendorID, the profile is loaded from
        # the vendorID's folder. This allows you to reuse profiles from module or LoRaWAN end device stack vendors.
        # If vendorID is empty, the current vendor ID is used. In this example, the vendorID is the current vendor ID,
        # which is verbose.
        # Identifier of the profile (lowercase, alphanumeric with dashes, max 36 characters)
