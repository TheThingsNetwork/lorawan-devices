# The KELLER payload is a little bit complicated as the device can have one or many level probes or pressure transmitter
# Therefore, a connection type defines the possible channels which again are mapped to physical units like pressure, temperature..
# See protocol: https://docs.kolibricloud.ch/sending-technology/lora-technology/keller-lora-payload/
# and the decoder on github: https://github.com/KELLERAGfuerDruckmesstechnik/KellerAgTheThingsNetworkPayloadDecoder
# The alternative is an open-source C# library that does the similar:  https://iotconverter.kolibricloud.ch/
