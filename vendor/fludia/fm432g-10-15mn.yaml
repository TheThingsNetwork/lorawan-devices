name: FM432g - Gas consumption sensor - 10/15 min
description: universal sensor transmitting gas consumption data from an existing meter to a server. It provides the ideal starting point for analyzing the level of consumption and offers a complete interoperability with IoT LoRa networks in order to rapidly report any change. It is the ideal device for deployment of energy efficiency services dedicated to Small and Medium Buildings, especially in the SoHo and residential markets
