name: Sound Level Meter
description: Device able to monitor noise levels due to its integrated microphone. It can analyze the surrounding ambient sound A-weighted, in the audible frequency spectrum for the human ear, showing the collected data in dBA. Developed based on the guidelines set out in Directive 2002/49 / CE of the European Parliament and of the Council, of June 25, 2002 and Law 37/2003 of November 17 published in the BOE of Spain both for noise pollution
