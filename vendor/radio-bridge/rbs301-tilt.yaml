name: RBS301-TILT - Low Precision Tilt Sensor
description: The indoor tilt sensor uses an accelerometer to detect transitions between horizontal and vertical orientation, as well as reporting the angle of tilt. When the sensor is rotated from horizontal to vertical or visa versa, an alert is sent to the wireless network. The thresholds for triggering a tilt event are configurable over the air. Applications include inclination monitoring, garage doors, pole lean detection, loading gates, and bay door orientation.
