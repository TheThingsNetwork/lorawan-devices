name: RBS306-420MA - 4-20mA Current Loop Sensor
description: The 4-20mA Current Loop Sensor can measure the current from another device or sensor. It uses a 10-bit ADC to measure an analog value between 4 and 20mA with a 10uA resolution.  If the measured value rises above or fails below the configured thresholds, an alert is sent over the wireless network. The weather-proof enclosure makes the sensor suitable for outdoor and industrial use. The 4-20mA sensor can also be used as a bridge device to enable a wide variety of sensors with only a 4-20mA output.
