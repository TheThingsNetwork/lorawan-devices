name: RBS306-MBHR - Maxbotix Ultrasonic Distance Sensor
description: The Maxbotix Ultrasonic Sensor measures distances between the sensor and objects using high-frequency sound pulses. If the distance exceeds or drops below a defined threshold, an alert is sent over the wireless network. It works with Maxbotix HR series sensors (models MB738, MB758, and MB7150). The weather-proof enclosure makes the sensor suitable for outdoor and industrial use.
