      EU863-870:
        # Optional identifier of the vendor of the profile. When you specify the vendorID, the profile is loaded from
        # the vendorID's folder. This allows you to reuse profiles from module or LoRaWAN end device stack vendors.
        # If vendorID is empty, the current vendor ID is used. In this example, the vendorID is the current vendor ID,
        # which is verbose.
