name: Lansitec NB-IoT Solar Bluetooth Gateway
description: This gateway receives nearby Bluetooth beacons, sensors, or controllersâ€™data, restructure, and forward it to a server via NB-IoT or LTE-M. It supports iBeacon, Eddystone, private protocols, and the scan and response feature. The solar panel and low-temperature rechargeable battery make it maintenance-free even in harsh enviroment.
