name: Contact Tracing Badge
description: Lansitec contact tracing badge is designed based on Bluetooth 5.0 and LoRaWAN technology. It uses RSSI for distance measurement and contact tracing. The badge is mainly used for keeping social distance at the workplace or hospital and is especially useful during COVID-19. Proximity detection function the badge beeps when other badges approach. The badge can use vibration and sound to alert the user even without the LoRaWAN network. NFC function is also integrated into the badge to facilitate management.

    # LoRaWAN Device Profiles per region
    # Supported regions are EU863-870, US902-928, AU915-928, AS923, CN779-787, EU433, CN470-510, KR920-923, IN865-867,

    profiles:
      EU863-870:
        # Optional identifier of the vendor of the profile. When you specify the vendorID, the profile is loaded from
        # the vendorID's folder. This allows you to reuse profiles from module or LoRaWAN end device stack vendors.
        # If vendorID is empty, the current vendor ID is used. In this example, the vendorID is the current vendor ID,
        # which is verbose.
        # vendorID: lansitec
        # Identifier of the profile (lowercase, alphanumeric with dashes, max 36 characters)
