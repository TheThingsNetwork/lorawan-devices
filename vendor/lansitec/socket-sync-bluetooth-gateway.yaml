name: SocketSync Bluetooth Gateway
description: The SocketSync Bluetooth Gateway is designed based on BLE and LoRa technology. With the advanced LoRa technology and built-in BLE module, the BLE gateway receives and reports the BLE devices messages to the LoRaWAN gateway. The parameter settings, such as the heartbeat period, LoRaWAN work mode, and sensor data to send in a BLE message, are adjustable as per customers’ requirements.

# Hardware versions (optional, use when you have revisions)
hardwareVersions:

    # Firmware features (optional)
    # Valid values are: remote rejoin (trigger a join from the application layer), transmission interval (configure how

    # LoRaWAN Device Profiles per region
    # Supported regions are EU863-870, US902-928, AU915-928, AS923, CN779-787, EU433, CN470-510, KR920-923, IN865-867,

    profiles:
      EU863-870:
        # Optional identifier of the vendor of the profile. When you specify the vendorID, the profile is loaded from
        # the vendorID's folder. This allows you to reuse profiles from module or LoRaWAN end device stack vendors.
        # If vendorID is empty, the current vendor ID is used. In this example, the vendorID is the current vendor ID,
        # which is verbose.
        # vendorID: lansitec
        # Identifier of the profile (lowercase, alphanumeric with dashes, max 36 characters)
