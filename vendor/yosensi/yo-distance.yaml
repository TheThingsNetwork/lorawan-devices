name: YO Distance
description: YO Distance is a LoRaWAN device for ultrasonic distance measurement. An example of using this device is monitoring the water level in the tank. Additionally, the device contains sensors that measure temperature, relative humidity and an accelerometer that enables to determine whether the device has been installed correctly.

        # Optional identifier of the vendor of the profile. When you specify the vendorID, the profile is loaded from
        # the vendorID's folder. This allows you to reuse profiles from module or LoRaWAN end device stack vendors.
        # If vendorID is empty, the current vendor ID is used. In this example, the vendorID is the current vendor ID,
        # which is verbose.
