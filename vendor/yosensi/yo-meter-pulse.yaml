name: YO Meter Pulse
description: The YO Meter Pulse input accepts connection to potential-free contacts. The device will not count pulses if the input is connected to contacts with any potential. Device input can detect pulses with different contact debounce times. This parameter is configurable and by default is 47 ms – up to max. 10 pulses per 1 s (boundary range 1-50 pulses per 1 s depends on the contact debouncing setting).
