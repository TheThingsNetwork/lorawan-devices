name: YO Meter Pulse
description: The YO Meter Pulse input accepts connection to potential-free contacts. The device will not count pulses if the input is connected to contacts with any potential. Device input can detect pulses with different contact debounce times. This parameter is configurable and by default is 47 ms – up to max. 10 pulses per 1 s (boundary range 1-50 pulses per 1 s depends on the contact debouncing setting).

        # Optional identifier of the vendor of the profile. When you specify the vendorID, the profile is loaded from
        # the vendorID's folder. This allows you to reuse profiles from module or LoRaWAN end device stack vendors.
        # If vendorID is empty, the current vendor ID is used. In this example, the vendorID is the current vendor ID,
        # which is verbose.
        #vendorID: 659
        # Identifier of the profile (lowercase, alphanumeric with dashes, max 36 characters)
