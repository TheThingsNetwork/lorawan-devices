name: YO Power
description: YO Power measures AC current flowing through devices connected to the mains. It can be fitted with up to six current clamps. It is possible to connect current-rated clamps with current output from almost every manufacturer. One YO Power device can measure multiple currents simultaneously (e.g. in one three-phase device, two three-phase devices, six single-phase devices, three single-phase devices, etc.).

        # Optional identifier of the vendor of the profile. When you specify the vendorID, the profile is loaded from
        # the vendorID's folder. This allows you to reuse profiles from module or LoRaWAN end device stack vendors.
        # If vendorID is empty, the current vendor ID is used. In this example, the vendorID is the current vendor ID,
        # which is verbose.
        #vendorID: 659
        # Identifier of the profile (lowercase, alphanumeric with dashes, max 36 characters)
