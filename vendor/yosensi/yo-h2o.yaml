name: YO H2O
description: YO H2O is a device that operates on a LoRaWAN network and is used for flood detection.The device also transmits measurements of temperature and humidity and sends information about its own position on x, y, z axes (using an in-built accelerometer).

      EU863-870:
        # Optional identifier of the vendor of the profile. When you specify the vendorID, the profile is loaded from
        # the vendorID's folder. This allows you to reuse profiles from module or LoRaWAN end device stack vendors.
        # If vendorID is empty, the current vendor ID is used. In this example, the vendorID is the current vendor ID,
        # which is verbose.
        #vendorID: 659
        # Identifier of the profile (lowercase, alphanumeric with dashes, max 36 characters)
