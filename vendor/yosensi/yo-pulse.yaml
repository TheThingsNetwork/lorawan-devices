name: YO Pulse
description: YO Pulse enables monitoring of logical states of devices and processes in automation and collection of pulses from measuring devices (e.g. water meters). The device provides six configurable measurement inputs, each of which can operate in one of three modes, normally open contact monitoring, normally closed contact monitoring, and pulse counting. The device enclosure has been designed to mount on electrical switchboards or automation cabinets on standard 35 mm DIN rails.
