name: YO People Counter
description: YO People Counter is a bi-directional device that uses a novel 24 GHz radar transceiver to detect motion from both directions simultaneously. This device detects a person moving independently when a certain distance exists between people and measures the speed of moving objects approaching the sensor. This device counts people flow in buildings, exhibitions, airports and more.
