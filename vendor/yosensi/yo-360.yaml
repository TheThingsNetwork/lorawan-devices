name: YO 360
description: YO 360 measures temperature and humidity, and it sends its own position on the x, y, and z axes (via a built-in accelerometer). Its small size, battery power supply, and wide data transmission range allow the device to be used virtually anywhere. Additionally, it comes in two enclosure types one for indoor use (material ABS) and another for outdoor use (epoxy resin). It is equipped with a lithium battery with a very low level of self-discharge, allowing data to be collected for years.

        # Optional identifier of the vendor of the profile. When you specify the vendorID, the profile is loaded from
        # the vendorID's folder. This allows you to reuse profiles from module or LoRaWAN end device stack vendors.
        # If vendorID is empty, the current vendor ID is used. In this example, the vendorID is the current vendor ID,
        # which is verbose.
