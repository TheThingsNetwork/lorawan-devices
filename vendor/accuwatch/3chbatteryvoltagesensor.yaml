name: LoraWan 3ch Voltage Sensor # Device name can not contain the vendor name
description: This custom-designed 3-Channel Battery Voltage Sensor is engineered to monitor the voltage of up to three separate batteries with a shared ground connection, making it ideal for applications where multiple batteries need simultaneous tracking. Constructed with an IP67-rated waterproof enclosure, it is built to withstand harsh environments, including marine and outdoor applications, where water and dust resistance are crucial.

        # Optional identifier of the vendor of the profile. When you specify the vendorID, the profile is loaded from
        # the vendorID's folder. This allows you to reuse profiles from module or LoRaWAN end device stack vendors.
        # If vendorID is empty, the current vendor ID is used. In this example, the vendorID is the current vendor ID,
        # which is verbose.
