name: JS0050
description: JS0050 is a LoRaWAN compliant rumen bolus designed to capture sheep activity, rumen temperature and movement. The material of the bolus is eco-friendly and causes no harm to the sheep. Once inserted into a sheep by a standard bolus gun, the bolus will remain in the rumen, All data is transmitted automatically first to the LoRa Base Station and then to a cloud-based platform, which allows farmers, vets, and scientists to process the information and deal with unexpected issues anytime, anywhere.
