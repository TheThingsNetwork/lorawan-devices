name: Ultrasonic Clamp-On Water Meter AQMLWE01
description: The water sensor clamp measures the flow and temperature in a water pipe using a "Time of Flight" measurement method and transmits the data wirelessly. Through an internal analysis of the flow, water leaks, and other anomalies are detected, and the owner is alerted. The device is clamped onto the outside of the water pipe without the need to interrupt the water supply. Its flexible design and innovative software allow it to be used on water pipes ranging from DN15 to DN40 (diameter 15â€¦50 mm) with all available materials in the market, such as PEX, PEX AL, copper, PE, or steel. It meets all the requirements of the European Metering Directive (MID). With a footprint of only 60 mm above the water pipe and a length of 110 mm, the device is very slim and short, making it easy to install.
