name: LoRain Rain Gauge RANLWE01
description: This rain sensor measures the amount of rainfall at its location using a tipping bucket mechanism, reporting the quantity within a 15-minute interval with an accuracy of 0.5 mm of water column and additionally provides the temperature. In the event of heavy rainfall exceeding 15 l/h, a heavy rain alarm is triggered promptly. Both the heavy rain threshold and the measurement interval are configurable. The sensor is powered by two AAA batteries. The supplied VARTA batteries allow for an approximate runtime of about 2 years. A low battery level is wirelessly reported, enabling the replacement of batteries before the device shuts down.
