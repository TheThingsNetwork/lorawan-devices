name: Water Pressure Sensor PRSWIE02
description: The Aqua-Scope pressure sensor records the water pressure in the drinking water distribution or in the hot water heating system. The device consists of two parts:(1) The main housing for signal processing and wireless communication with a battery compartment. (2) The external sensor head, which is connected to the water pipe. The stainless steel sensor head features a silicon sensor suspended in silicone oil for highly accurate and low-noise pressure measurements. The pressure measurement range is between 1 to 10 bar. The sensor head is installed somewhere in the building at a 1/8-inch inspection opening or with a provided T-piece under any sink at the angle valve.
