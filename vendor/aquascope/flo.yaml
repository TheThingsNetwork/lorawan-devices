name: Flood Sensor FLOLWE01
description: The Flood Sensor detects the presence of water on its exposed sensor pins and sends an alarm message wirelessly when triggered. In addition, the device will regularly report the ambient temperature and humidity and send an alarm when the readings exceed thresholds that can be set for both humidity and temperature. The device itself is designed to sit on the floor, where 3 brass telescopic pins can detect water on both hard floors (tiles) and soft carpets. The unit comes with a mounting bracket. It can be screwed or taped to the wall or floor. When the main sensor is in the bracket, a super-flat sensor pad connected by wire to the bracket is used to detect water. When an alarm is active, the unit emits a sound and a red LED flash. The device is powered by an internal CR123 battery that lasts approximately 5 years in normal operation.
