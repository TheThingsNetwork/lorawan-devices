# The profileIDs is a distinct value for every unique profile listed in the vendor's folder.
# This value can be freely issued by the vendor and is also used on the QR code for LoRaWAN devices, see
# https://lora-alliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/TR005_LoRaWAN_Device_Identification_QR_Codes.pdf#page=8
# It can either be a combo of device ID + hardware version + firmware version + region, or profile ID + codec ID
# NOTE: The profileIDs is different from the vendorID.
