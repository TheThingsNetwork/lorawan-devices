name: Abeeway Geolocation Module
description: >
  The Abeeway Geolocation Module is a multi-technology fused location module designed as the ideal platform to develop a wide range of 
  battery-powered tracking solutions, minimizing the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) of IoT geolocation use cases. It is s co-developed and manufactured 
  by Murata, and integrates leading-edge technology from Semtech and STMicroelectronics.
  This LoRaWAN fused location module contains a high-performance multi-constellation GNSS receiver (GPS, GLONASS, Beidou, and Galileo) and supports a 
  patented ultra- Low â€“ Power GPS (LP GPS) modeI, allowing your engineering to focus on the use case, to optimize time-to-market and cost by using less complex
  PCBs (all high-density devices being encapsulated), to reduce certification risk and budget, as well as testing time and cost for mass production.
