name: track
description: The TRACK+ outdoor air quality monitoring station is connected via LoRaWAN or 4G LTE, powered by battery, mains, DC voltage or solar energy, and configurable via NFC. The station incorporates sensors to measure fine particles, temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, and offers automatic geolocation via GPS. It is designe for outdoor use with simplified maintenance.
