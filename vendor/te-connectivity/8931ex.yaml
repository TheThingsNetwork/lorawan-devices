name: 8931EX - Triaxis Vibration Sensor
description: The TE model 8931EX wireless vibration sensor combines a tri axis accelerometer, a bundled DSP (FFT peak search), a data collector, and a radio into one compact, battery operated device that measures both vibration and temperature data. It was designed for hash environment and comes with the ATEX certification.
